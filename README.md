Created using PyQt5. 

# How to run
(Dependencies: openpyxl, pyqt5)

Make sure you have PyQt5 and Openpyxl installed. To check go to your terminal and type ```pip3 show PyQt5``` and ```pip3 show openpyxl```. 

If it is not installed then make sure to install it by typing ```pip3 install PyQt5``` and ```pip3 install openpyxl```. 

As of now, to run the main app click on ```main.py``` and run the file.
