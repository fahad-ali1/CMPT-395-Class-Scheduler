 ## Installation
 If you have python3 installed (you can install python [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\) Otherwise, download the `.exe` file under the releases section (W.I.P.).
 
 ## Dependencies
 Currently, the project is dependent on [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) and [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/)\. You can install these by running:
 ```
 pip install PyQt5 openpyxl
 ```
 Please note that these dependencies aren't necessary if you download and run the `.exe` version.
 
 ## How To Run
 As stated above, please make sure you have both `PyQt5` and `openpyxl` packages installed. Besides that, all you need to do is either double click the `main.py` file or run the following terminal command in Powershell:
