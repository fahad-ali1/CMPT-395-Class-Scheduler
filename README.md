# GUI and Cohort functionality
Created using PyQt5. 

# How to run
Make sure you have PyQt5 installed. To check go to your terminal and type `pip3 show PyQt5`. 

If it is not installed then make sure to install it by typing `pip3 install PyQt5`. 

As of now, to run the app double click main.py, or run `python main.py` in a terminal if you're on windows. On Linux or Mac you can replace `python` with `python3`.
